The property is run down and needs some attention. Our room wasn't as clean as it should have been, the bathroom dingy, especially the bathtub, and water stains are visible in the bathroom, as well as sloppy work, like paint spattered on the floor and tile missing. I can live with that, but I can't live with false advertisement. They advertise on the website (and show pictures) of the ""free"" breakfast spread. I actually called to ask again if they have breakfast and they said they did. I happen to like breakfast and was very disappointed when my husband and I went downstairs to receive a paper bag with water, cake, fruit bar and an apple. Other than the apple, for many people, this wasn't a healthy, nor looking at their pictures on line, the breakfast promised. My husband and I wanted to take a few days off from our business and we were looking forward to cooling off in their pool. The pool was filthy, with food wrapping and used diapers spread all over. I asked twice to remove the dirty diapers with no result. Trust me when I say we really didn't want to go into the pool. Also, they have rules that the maximum capacity for the pool is 7 people. We counted 12, all under 12 years old, screaming their way to ecstasy. For the money we paid, I can't recommend this hotel.", July 2021,none," find another hotel, but if stuck, get a room on the opposite side of the highway!!!",1,,4,,4,4,

Although breakfast has been suspended due to COVID that no problem they still provide you with a bagged breakfast and if you are like me and need a hot breakfast there is an awesome 24hr Diner that is amazing. A lot celebs go there and a gas station and Dublin donuts that’s literally two doors down.

First location is terrible. It sets high on a hill but you can’t make a left turn into or out of the parking lot. You have to go down the street and turn around. This can be tricky due to the traffic in the area. When entering the parking lot there’s a small sign directing a u turn then up the hill for checkin. The handicap ramp is from the parking area and not in front of the checkin. Checkin was basically ok no welcome just name and here’s your room key. Did not get the room requested although I made reservations 6 months ago and was told plenty rooms were available like I wanted. Clerk did not even say sorry just not available. Also did not receive the bottle of water as a honors member. Now to get to the room we had to park up the hill to the second floor level. Take our bags walk around the pool enter the second floor walk down the hallway to the elevator then up to our floor. At our room the door was damaged, looked like someone had previously tried to break in. The inside safety latch was very loose almost ready to fall off. Inside room was good size but bathroom was very small. Could not open door when setting on toilet. Rust in bathtub. Room decor was outdated still had popcorn ceiling. Rug stained and old. There was no safe in the room for security no microwave. Internet service was very poor in the room. Breakfast was pitiful it came in a bag small breakfast bar, small piece of what tasted like cake. Coffee weak all most water. We left it. Management needs to get busy and update, clean up, repair and improve checkin service.

So far on this road trip we have stayed in six Hampton Inns and this is by far the worst.", June 2021, Traveled as a couple,none,2,,,,,,
