The property is run down and needs some attention. Our room wasn't as clean as it should have been, the bathroom dingy, especially the bathtub, and water stains are visible in the bathroom, as well as sloppy work, like paint spattered on the floor and tile missing. I can live with that, but I can't live with false advertisement. They advertise on the website (and show pictures) of the ""free"" breakfast spread. I actually called to ask again if they have breakfast and they said they did.

3,,, July 2021,,none,,,,none,,"Columbia, South Carolina","Rooms were clean, lobby was clean & smelled very inviting. Staff was pleasant & professional.Coffee and breakfast was good and fresh each day. Would definitely stay there again and, recommend others to stay as well."
4,,, July 2021,,none,,,,none,,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",Clean and manager very helpful. Affordable rates. Breakfast was hard to find. I’m assuming due to COVID is was a boxed breakfast. We did not eat at hotel. Check in and check out was easy. Was given the wrong room but was compensated for that
5,,, June 2021,,none,,,,none,,None,"When we arrived, the woman at the front desk was very rude and the elevator broken. Our room was filthy, dust and grime all over the bathroom counters and a brown smear mark on the wall with a strong odor in the room. We ended up not staying the night and leaving because we felt so uncomfortable. We would not recommend this location."
