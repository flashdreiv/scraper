The property is run down and needs some attention. Our room wasn't as clean as it should have been, the bathroom dingy, especially the bathtub, and water stains are visible in the bathroom, as well as sloppy work, like paint spattered on the floor and tile missing. I can live with that, but I can't live with false advertisement. They advertise on the website (and show pictures) of the ""free"" breakfast spread. I actually called to ask again if they have breakfast and they said they did. I happen to like breakfast and was very disappointed when my husband and I went downstairs to receive a paper bag with water, cake, fruit bar and an apple. Other than the apple, for many people, this wasn't a healthy, nor looking at their pictures on line, the breakfast promised. My husband and I wanted to take a few days off from our business and we were looking forward to cooling off in their pool. The pool was filthy, with food wrapping and used diapers spread all over. I asked twice to remove the dirty diapers with no result. Trust me when I say we really didn't want to go into the pool. Also, they have rules that the maximum capacity for the pool is 7 people. We counted 12, all under 12 years old, screaming their way to ecstasy. For the money we paid, I can't recommend this hotel.", July 2021,none," find another hotel, but if stuck, get a room on the opposite side of the highway!!!",1,,4,,4,4,,,

First location is terrible. It sets high on a hill but you can’t make a left turn into or out of the parking lot. You have to go down the street and turn around. This can be tricky due to the traffic in the area. When entering the parking lot there’s a small sign directing a u turn then up the hill for checkin. The handicap ramp is from the parking area and not in front of the checkin. Checkin was basically ok no welcome just name and here’s your room key. Did not get the room requested although I made reservations 6 months ago and was told plenty rooms were available like I wanted. Clerk did not even say sorry just not available. Also did not receive the bottle of water as a honors member. Now to get to the room we had to park up the hill to the second floor level. Take our bags walk around the pool enter the second floor walk down the hallway to the elevator then up to our floor. At our room the door was damaged, looked like someone had previously tried to break in. The inside safety latch was very loose almost ready to fall off. Inside room was good size but bathroom was very small. Could not open door when setting on toilet. Rust in bathtub. Room decor was outdated still had popcorn ceiling. Rug stained and old. There was no safe in the room for security no microwave. Internet service was very poor in the room. Breakfast was pitiful it came in a bag small breakfast bar, small piece of what tasted like cake. Coffee weak all most water. We left it. Management needs to get busy and update, clean up, repair and improve checkin service.

Upon check in the room was sufficient and clean, but the door to the hallway was lose and let a lot of light in. The next few days the 1st floor near the elevators and the back entrance always smelt of marijuana and people were smoking marijuana in their vehicles with the windows rolled down. I watched at least 6 people come in and out of the hotel back entrance with no mask and roam the hallways and use the elevator with no mask. I was in the elevator and someone came in with no mask also. The hotel has security cameras throughout the hallways which you can see behind the front desk but no one uses them to enforce rules.

It so happened that we stayed here in mid March when the pandemic was just emerging and I thought that the precautions they were taking then were very diligent. We had me travel from Florida to this area again in June and because of our prior experience, and because of reading about Hilton's  cleaning  policies, I chose to stay here again. First of all, I believe that the Hilton policy does not necessarily apply to all hotels that have the Hilton brand and this is something that needs to be checked by all travelers. In addition, the lack of precautions at this hotel was alarming. Even though it is located in New York , almost none of the guests wore masks, and the staff did not ask the guests to wear a mask.  This was in contrast to just about every other business I visited in the Westchester Tarrytown area. I believe that the hotel suffers from poor management. As an example, the entrance/exit lobby was being mopped at 8 AM, at a time when people are more prone to exit. Why they shouldn’t have been done so at an earlier or later hour is beyond me.  Also, when we went to a room one night, they were too young men, not kids but young men, wrestling in the hallway. There were no sanitizer dispensers available in common areas (although there had been in March when we were there). .  We were told by a staff member that the hotel was being used by many individuals who were working on construction projects nearby.  For whatever reasons, those guests did not wear a mask and that made our entire experience stressful. To their credit, the clerks were polite and in fact refunded one night's rate because of the wrestling incident. Even so, we left the hotel and stayed at a nearby hotel of a different brand where the precautions were totally in place and provided greater concerns for safety.", June 2020,none,none,1,,3,3,,3,,,

There was no clock in the room, which I don't think I have experienced in event he cheapest hotels I have stayed in. There were big areas of the ceiling that had clearly been patched, but not with the same texture/color as the original ceiling.

The furnishings in the room are really low quality and show extensive wear. It looks like the hotel tried to make the appearance of a makeover using the cheapest items they could find.

I was attending an event for New Years and wanted to be close enough to uber there and back. When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a tall, lively African American gentleman , who thanked me for being a member and invited me to the hotels New Years function later that night. When I got to my room, I wasn’t overly impressed with the decor, but it will do for one night. The problem with my stay began when I went to step into the shower and there was hair in my bath tub. Yuck, it was disgusting. I had to use a tissue to remove the previous guests hair before I could shower. Great. After that, I realized that there were no washcloths in the room at all. Only hand towels and bath towels. I sighed, and wrapped in my towel went to call the front desk for assistance. The phone rang for several minutes with no answer. I then peeked outside my room to see if by luck, housekeeping was in the hallway. When I saw a cart two rooms down, I thought, Yesssss I'm saved. ' Excuse me miss, May I have a washcloth?"" Without looking up, she responded "" I don't have any"". Huh. So I retreat back into my room and try guest services on the phone. To my surprise a female picked up, I asked her for a few washcloths to please be sent up to my room.......I waited for 30 minutes and received nothing. Finally I took matters into my own hands, got dressed, and went downstairs. When I got to the lobby, I found that there are in fact two employees standing at the front desk. I patiently waited for a hispanc female who's name begins with H to call me up. Taking a deep breath , I informed her of my ridiculous wait time for two measly washcloths and also the condition of my tub when I arrived. Without apologizing, she looked at me, turned and went to a back room. When she emerged, she had two washcloths. Sigh. I rushed back upstairs, jumped in the shower, and tried my best not to allow that issue to ruin my New Years Eve. I mean I'm only paying $185 to stay here. Is it too much to ask to have a washcloth and a clean tub? I'm so dissatisfied with my stay. I've stayed at Hiltons in different states and never have an issue. My loyalty to the company comes from my late uncle who worked for the Hilton for over 20 years. I will never stay at this location again. Do better", January 2020, Traveled solo,none,1,3,3,3,3,3,3,,

When booking the room over the phone I was told that the rooms had microwaves and refrigerators. When we got to our room there was a musty, old odor to it and no microwave. I called the front desk and the receptionist said that not all rooms have microwaves and that I had to request it at check in. If they had one available, they would send it up- if not I would have to use the one in the lobby. She said she would call me to let me know. I never received the call and resorted to eating cold food. I sprayed everything down with Lysol because the furniture was so worn and soiled on the couch arms. The TV was outdated and an older model. When I went to take my shower, the bath towel had a large ball of hair in it. When I complained to the front desk, all she said was that she would make sure the head of housekeeping knew it. When we went to breakfast we had to wait to get on the elevator because only one was working. It literally had to stop on every floor from 7-1 coming down and then every floor from 1-4 going up. Luckily we got on as it was going down to go up because on the way up, the cleaning crew was at the elevator on the ground floor and the 3rd floor. They had to wait because the elevator was too full for them to get on. (what poor management and waste of money for the workers not being able to do their job).

The bathroom in my room was tiny, and the lack of a curved shower rod over the standard sized tub made the shower feel super small, as well.

The good: comfortable bed, generally quiet HVAC with the option for continuous fan to mask outside noise, average-speed wi-fi, large TV with good digital channel selections. Large area off the lobby for breakfast, so it wasn’t crowded.

The mediocre: cleanliness – this is not the cleanest of Hampton Inns. Lots of dust and hair on my bathroom floor, piece of trash on the carpet next to the HVAC. Dorm-style refrigerator literally sitting on the floor next to the desk – no cabinet for it, and no microwave? And, the hotel has signs posted that they are under renovation, so only one elevator is working, leaving a long wait for it at times. Breakfast – while it’s standard Hampton fare, it just seemed lackluster – reheated scrambled eggs, undercooked “hard boiled” eggs, small slices of sausage, and small slices of French toast. Cost cutting or the new norm?

What the hotel lacks in product quality is made up by service – the desk staff at check-in were wonderful, very friendly, and acknowledged my HHONORS Gold status.", February 2019, Traveled on business, take a low floor to avoid lengthy elevator waits,3,,5,,,5,5,,

We really enjoyed this place, and I have to say Rudy at the front desk was amazing. He went out of his way to be helpful, friendly, and he paid attention to what we said, which is something I never find. I was there on business, and he asked me later the next day how did my legal argument go. I couldn't believe it! He remembered exactly what I had told him the day before. Plus, the first night, I needed some salt and a plastic fork, which the take-out place didn't give me. He had salt behind the desk, but he offered to get a fork for me from the breakfast place, even though the utensils were locked up. He got it for me, and he came back with two forks. He's one of the friendliest people I ever met at a hotel. The room was great. Very comfortable bed, nice shower, and wow, the couch with two terrific foot cubes/stools was awesome. I was able to study for my legal argument in comfort that night. The place is well-run, as they had deep-cleaned the rugs and couches before we got there, and they were doing that throughout the building. We've stayed at places which obviously didn't do that. Nice touch having a place to sit while waiting for the elevator. The managers obviously care about this place and how it looks. The only thing I wish they had were microwaves in the room. Hopefully they will add that. Many hotels have that, so I missed it, but otherwise, it was a great place. Breakfast room is really nice -- nicely decorated and pleasant, comfortable, with lots of seating. This was not the fault of the hotel, as I spoke with someone from the hotel, but the juice machine is too watery (orange and cranberry), and that's the fault of the company who claims that everything with it is fine (it isn't). However, regarding breakfast, there are fresh fruit options, including a fruit salad, plus apples, and bananas. There are some hot foods, some cereals and pastries, etc. Would definitely stay there again. Thanks Rudy! You should be employee of the month! Also, I asked for a quiet room, and I got one.

It's a little tricky to get to the actual property with the winding and convoluted highways, but we quickly figured it out. There was plenty of free parking, although note the parking lot is multi-level, as the hotel sits on a hillside, so you may have to take some steps up/down or walk up/down a hill to get to the lobby.

The hotel has undergone some renovations, so our King room on floor 7 was nicely updated and comfortable, with new fixtures and decor. It had all the amenities I've come to expect with a Hampton Inn property, including a super comfy bed, and Neutrogena products in the bathroom. One really cool added extra was the charging stations on both nightstands. YES, someone finally gets it! Each charging station had at least two AC ports and two USB ports. A very nice touch. I also liked the smaller/streamlined TV stand (rather than a clunky dresser that's mostly useless for short stays) and two footstool/cushions that double as luggage stands. Very sensible!

The only complaint I had about the room is that the bathroom is very small. The door almost hits the tiny toilet, and the bathtub is so narrow, it's almost like you're showering in a horse trough. ha. Seriously though - the bathroom has been updated with a more modern type of flooring and shelves, which is nice. It was all perfectly acceptable and wasn't a deal breaker - I would've just preferred that the room was designed with a bigger bathroom, even if that means the small sofa in the bedroom was removed. I would guess that guests often don't use the sofa at all, whereas they will always make use of the bathroom.

The complimentary WiFi worked just fine, so no complaints there. The complimentary breakfast was typical Hampton Inn quality. I do love the little cinnamon rolls - yum. The breakfast area had plenty of seating, all centered around a cozy fireplace. There was complimentary coffee/tea/hot cocoa in front of the check-in desk 24/7, and the staff were all very pleasant and helpful. When we were there, one of the two elevators was out of service for renovations, so that made getting up/down a bit tricky, as the hotel was full. That'll likely be a temporary inconvenience, though.

Overall, a lovely stay here - would stay at this property again if in the area.", October 2018, Traveled as a couple, Rooms facing the hill/forest are likely quieter than those facing the highways.,4,,,4,4,4,,,

The front desk staff were friendly and the room was neat and clean. I appreciated the fact that the sink wasn't outside the bathroom. I hate when a room is designed that way!

But the fan in the bathroom wasn't working and the towel bar was awkward to use. Not a big deal, but noticeable. There was no literature in the room about the area or the hotel amenities. My friend and I were looking forward to renting a movie when we got back to the hotel on Saturday night, but there was no information about that or the television itself. When we asked the people at the front desk, they didn't seem to know. The remote for the TV only had volume and channel buttons, no info or guide buttons, so you just had to flip around to find something. Again, this is not a deal breaker, just disappointing. The doors to the rooms were weighted (which is a good thing), but the tendency is for people to let them go until they slam shut. I know this wasn't intentional on anyone's part (I did it myself), but it did make it kind of noisy at night.

One the negative side, there were no dressers and no safes. There was one suitcase rack, so our small suitcase went on the desk. We were just there for a night, so it wasn't that big a deal, but I would not have felt ""settled"" if I had to stay there longer. The hotel is high on a hill, and when you drive in, it is not obvious where to go - we were wondering if we pulled up to the front stairs, would we have to go out and around in the traffic again to get to the first parking area.

But the hotel is not that good. The staff is absolutely kind, friendly and helpful, there is no doubt about that.
But the building and interior are quite dated and the rooms are incredibly humid. Our clothes and even some books were wet after 5 days of staying here. A big PLUS are the excellent beds.
We just cannot understand why a hotel has a carpet in the breakfast-area; it is not hygienic and the first morning there was a lot of people in this place with many loud children who made a huge mess everywhere. The next mornings the area was more quiet, but still we did not like the plastic cutlery and the paper plates which look so cheap. Moreover the bread and breakfast-cakes were dried out.
In other reviews we learned that one of the elevators was not working 7 months ago and still this elevator was not working when we stayed here. The management for updating the rooms, the interior and exterior is quite bad or even inexistant. The airconditioning in the rooms is quite noisy.
The distance from Elmsford to New York City is quite long (35 kms), so it is good to have a car, but still we payed a lot of money for parkings In NY. A trip by express-train from the White Plains-station will take about 20 minutes.

It's definitely a place for families and quick layovers. I wouldn't recommend this for any travelling business people looking for an extended stay however since there are much more business traveler orientated places nearby.

Check in was great. The front desk was really accommodating and was able to get me check-in before the 3pm normal check in time. This was a big help since I got there pretty early at 12. I even saw her deal with a difficult customer and it was a great example of grace under pressure. Again, because it's a hotel that families passing through tend to stay at, you're going to have people unfamiliar with finer details of hotel stays.

The room as typical and no surprises there however it was very clean. Probably the cleanest of Hampton Inns I've stayed at. The bathroom as a bit cramped but not terrible. Definitely ask for the 7th floor as it is the most quiet.

Breakfast had no surprises as well. Nothing too exciting but it wasn't a bad experience although you should get there early (before 7:30) to avoid the families coming down.

Location was a bit tough due to the local traffic and it's not the most scenic part of town. However it's close to a great diner that is open 24/7.

Overall: Not stands out but sometimes that's a good thing. It took care of what everyone needed for the 1 night stay.", July 2018, Traveled with family, Any room on the 7th floor is the best choice for a quiet night. Lower floor if you have kids...,3,4,,,,4,4,,

I had stayed at this hotel once before and promised myself that I would never repeat the mistake; It was after I arrived at the hotel that I realized that I had actually inadvertently made it again.

The hotel has no dressers so there are no drawers for you to store your little belongings. Yes, you heard that right. The only two tiny dressers were to the sides of the bed in the night stands.

The hotel also does not have enough refrigerators. You have to ask for one and they will bring it to you but be ready because it'll make noise so strong that you'll either need earplugs or you have to unplug it from the wall.

The room I first checked in smelled of chemicals (dust spray or carpet dust) which was used in huge amounts. I could not breath and so I had to change rooms. The front desk was very accommodating and friendly.

The only redeeming quality of this hotel is that it is about 0.3 miles from the ramp onto 287 (E). As mentioned above, the staff at the front desk was polite and helpful.

The system was still down when we checked out the next morning (although they followed up promptly with an email receipt). The hotel has been recently renovated bringing it more or less in line with the newer Hampton properties. Generally the decor is fresh and more contemporary however much of the renovation work is pretty sloppy (sorry but I am an architect). It is also clear the much if not most of the room furniture is left over from pre-renovation days as it chipped and in some cases very dirty (the base of the floor lamp looked like it had not been cleaned in years). Details matter. This Hampton Inn should pay more attention to the details. That said, the hotel is an acceptable stop for an overnight stay. Included breakfast is standard Hampton Inn fare.

I have always found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. They always greet you with a smile and seem to genuinely care.

The challenges with this hotel include the fact it is built on a hill, so lower parking requires climbing a decent amount of steps. Even pulling up to the entrance requires a walk up some steps. Never easy when hauling suitcases and brief bags. The main bedroom is relatively good size, but the bathroom is small and not easy to navigate if more than one person. The bathroom door barely misses the toilet.

The hotel no longer offers newspapers, which is a disappointment for a business traveler like me. But, in today’s day of electronics, I guess most people have moved away from newspapers and instead check their phones and social media.

Like all Hampton’s this one offers a free breakfast with the usual options, but was missing fresh fruit such as bananas, apples and oranges. They did have a bowl of mixed cut up fruit but make the same mistake others have done mixing citrus fruit with other fruit that creates a bad flavor when mixed. Uncut and unmixed fruit would provide an option for those of us that do not want the mixed. They also need to check their milk occasionally. The skim milk was going sour.

When I first arrived in the room, it was missing a night stand clock. They were very quick to deliver a clock. Again, the person who brought the clock was very friendly, quick and efficient.

The facility is starting to get tired. They were just beginning the process to change the door locks to electronic instead of sliding the key card into a slot. But, the rooms and general areas will soon need a remodeling.

There was so much uncertainty with where we were going to stay next especially with another snow storm on the way and our boys both getting feverishly sick. Venessa reassured us at she will not leave us out in the cold and she found ways to help us. We are so greatful to Venessa and others at the hotel.

The bed wasn't made, the bathroom not cleaned - basically nothing was done. What exactly were we paying for? Breakfast on Sunday was a mess. There was a school group whose members said they were supposed to have a separate breakfast area set up for their large group.

I specified a 3:00 pm arrival. I arrived at 2:55 pm and was told by the desk clerk that I had a room with a queen bed. The clerk then asked if a queen bed was ok. I asked if they had any kings and she said no, so I'm wondering why she even asked. She then told me that the room I had picked out was not ready. So we sat down and about 10 minutes later the clerk brought me a room key. Come to find out she put me on the 6th floor on the highway side! The clerk called me in that room about 5 minutes after I entered it and inquired if the room was satisfactory. I told her no that I wanted a room on the woods side. She agreed to let me return the key and that she would get me into the room I had previously reserved on the 7th floor. We then left for a couple of hours and when we returned the room was ready. During the night it started raining and we started hearing a drip in the bathroom. The roof was leaking and water was dripping out of the can light in the bathroom. We couldn't even use the toilet without getting wet from this. We called down to the front desk to report this and request another room but no one answered the phone. We checked out about 5 am and told the desk clerk about the problem. My wife asked for some sort of monetary compensation and the clerk said she couldn't do anything about it because she was just the night auditor. She said only the manager could do anything and that the manager wouldn't be in until 11 am. So much for the Hampton guarantee!

Here is my two cents...

1. The construction isn’t an issue at night or early am. If you plan to work from hotel during the day you might want to reconsider. Renovation is major and well needed.

2. The property is built into a hill. The parking lots are stacked and the walk down is steep. Look for the stairwell on your right (near the pool) if the ground is wet. Better safe than sorry.

3. Pick your room carefully. One side faces a noisy roadway; the other faces a hilly embankment. You want the latter. Go even numbers.

Overall very good business hotel. Good breakfast and lots of restaurants within a short drive. Great staff and comfortable beds.

Note to management - you know those “we’ve got you covered”signs in the bathroom. Well don’t kid yourself. Both stays I asked the front desk for shaving cream. Both times you were out. So much for that complimentary replacement.", October 2017, Traveled on business,none,4,,,,,,,,

The staff has to be some of the nicest people I have dealt with in a while. I was admittedly tired and grumpy when checking in however they were extremely nice and even offered to have a shuttle to drive me to the nearest convenience store so I could have a few beers to unwind. Since checking in and the shuttle ride I've spoken to the front desk again to ask about a shuttle to the airport (they don't do which is understandable) and the lady making the breakfast and both of these additional times the staff was just exceptional. They were polite, attentive and focused on me and made me feel important. I'm not overly easy to please when it comes to customer service but I have to say this Hampton Inn has far exceeded my expectations in that arena.

Since a hotel stay is more than just the staff you deal with a few more comments in case it helps.

1. The room was nice, clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable as well. I also liked the fact the fan in the room would run continuously to provide some white noise.

2. The wifi while free isn't overly fast, but it's ""free"" so...

3. Even though I'm not handicapped I stayed in a handicap room and I was thinking about the attention to detail that went into designing it and was impressed and thought some of the modifications made to the room would be very helpful for someone that needed them.

4. Finally, the breakfast wasn't great to me but it was good. Nothing was wrong with it but it didn't wow me either.

All in all this was a great stay and I'll definitely be staying here in the future should my travels bring me this way again.", May 2017, Traveled on business,none,4,,,,5,5,5,,

I made a reservation directly with the hotel after midnight as I was drivng up from the DC area. The lady at the front desk was very pleasant and helpful. When I arrived at the hotel sometime after 1 am, the desk clerk remembered me and the check in process was very efficient. When I went to my room, the key didn't work. I went downstairs to get a new key and the lady asked that I call her if I get into my room. If I didn't call in 2 minutes, she would come up to the room. The key didn't work and as promised she came up to the room. After several minutes of trying to open the door, it turned out that someone was in the room (oops!). I got a new room and settled in for a few hours of sleep before checking out. Of course this wasn't the smoothest check in experience, but the desk clerk handled this so well that I was not irritated, only tired.

The room looked great, but it smelled bad. I stay at hotels about 50 nights a year, so I realize there are various aromas in the hotels, but this smelled like dirt and dirty socks. At this point I was dead tired and only wanted to go to bed. I sprayed the room with cologne and settled in for a few hours of sleep before checking out. My 3 star rating is a reflection of the smelly room. The hotel looks good and the staff was very helpful and friendly. I would have rated this 4 stars if the room did not smell.", April 2017, Traveled solo,none,3,,,,,,,,

At that time I wasn't impressed with it and described it as a ""run of the mill"" chain hotel. Well, it's amazing how time can change things. I've stayed in a full service Marriott for $280/nite, an Extended Stay (big mistake) for $99/night and this hotel for $146/night - all of these hotels being with 1/2 mile or less from one another. By far the Hampton Inn is now at the top of my list. Yesterday I wrote a review of the Extended Stay so I won't bother with comparing that here. But compared to the full service Marriott, with the exception of the Marriott having restaurants and indoor pool (noisy if your room is on the pool side of the hotel), the Hampton Inn was equally as good. This hotel has beautiful rooms, amazingly comfortable beds and an OUTSTANDING free continental breakfast. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The lobby and dining area are large, quiet and very welcoming.

There were free cookies and coffee/tea in the lobby upon our arrival and the folks at the registration desk were very friendly and helpful. It is a little tricky getting into the Inn; be sure to follow directions as the highways are usually busy and 3-4 lanes. There are a variety of restaurants within a 3-5 minute drive. The Saw Mill Pkwy is just down the road and gives one a direct, quick drive into the city. Staying here is much cheaper than a hotel in Manhattan and with a car one can get around to the local historical sites as well.

We had an event to attend at the Westchester County Center and also wanted to go into NYC for a day so figured this was a good location. Check in was quick. We requested a hotel shuttle to the event center and the driver drove us right in. I called at 9:50pm to get a shuttle back to the hotel was told it wasn't running, but they did call a cab for me (after I asked them to). It cost $12 for a cab from WCC back to the hotel. The next morning we drove into the White Plains train station and parked the car in the parking garage and took the express train into NYC. It was an easy drive to the train station, and and easy train ride in. We took the 11:13 train out of NYC and were back in our hotel room by 12:30. Parking at the train station was about $9 for the day.
the breakfasts were the normal Hampton Inn deal, the dining area was large but the buffet area was not. although any time I ate there was not a big crowd so it didn't effect me.
the room was clean. I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews but the chairs and bedding were not ""worn"" or dirty. The bathroom was small. the only thing that was not up to par was the bath tub. I wore my flip flops in the shower as it was stained and I didn't like the look of it.
parking was on different levels, but easy to access...and free :).
we were in room 520 which is right next to the elevators and were worried about noise but didn't notice anything and definitely didn't effect our sleep.
overall we were happy with our stay. a bit pricey...but the cheapest quality hotel in that area.", October 2016,none,none,4,,,,,,,,

I used my Hilton Honors app to find this hotel. It was close to the highway and easy to get to. The price was supposed to be $120 per night with our military discount according to the app. When the front desk attendant quoted me $189.00 I asked for the military discount and she said it would have been more! I didn't realize I had been overcharged almost $70.00 until I checked out and looked at the app again once on the road. I'm really disappointed that I feel like someone took advantage of the fact that we were half exhausted at check in.

We were on the 5th floor so we had a great view of the woods. However, perhaps due to our late arrival time, we were placed in the smallest room on the floor. (I checked the fire evacuation map). It was so small in fact, my 6 year old son's first comment when we arrived was that it looked like a cabin on a cruise ship. The bathroom was the worst of all. The door opens inward and it literally comes inches away from hitting the toilet. The bathroom was so small in fact, I could not stand in there with my six year old at the same time. I had to supervise him brushing his teeth from outside the bathroom. There was absolutely no way we could both be in there and close the door unless I stood in the bathtub. By far the worst experience in the bathroom was the fact that the shower water did not get hot-ever. I took a shower at 2:00 a.m. and it was barely luke warm. After some rest, before hitting the road, my husband and son took showers and had the same experience. When I went downstairs to address the issue with the front desk, there were at least three employees standing there speaking to each other and ignoring me. I was disturbed by this but waited until they addressed me and informed them of the issue. No one seemed all that concerned. At check out, an hour later, another person was again at the front desk in discussion with someone else. I guess he was preoccupied because he took my keys and didn't bother to ask me about my stay. I volunteered the information about the shower which he promised to have fixed. Overall, this wasn't a good experience in a hotel could use more attentive staff. This was the most disappointing and overpriced 9 hour stay I've ever had. Skip this place if you have any other choices.", September 2016, Traveled with family,none,2,,,,,,,,

Second room, although we had specially requested a quiet room, had very thin walls so we could clearly hear the people next door having a conversation.
Although we had specifically requested that our room be located away from any air handler, a very large air handler (the very noisy part of an air conditioning system) was located directly, about eight feet, outside our window with two other small air handlers located near our window. The noise was very loud and constant through the night making sleep next to impossible.
TV was old had a blurry picture and color was too dark.
Although we had asked for two queen beds only doubles were available.
There was at least one inch of space between the bottom of the entry door and the threshold letting in light and noise.
Person in charge of breakfast room made an issue about taking a tray to take food to our room.
Scrambled eggs came out of a plastic bag and tasted like it.
No refrigerator or microwave.
Had to talk with manager the next morning to get check put and cancel the remaining four days we had booked.
The positive: The manager let us out of the five day reservation and gave us the room for free because of our issues.", October 2015, Traveled with family,none,1,,,,4,4,4,,

There is a covered entry way, but there is no way to get a luggage cart up the stairs, so if it is raining or snowing, you have to wait until it stops or carry it up stairs to the front entrance. If is clear, there is an uncovered ramp to bring the cart up.

Bathroom a little small and although bath tub had an anti-skid bottom, it was rounded and stepping in for me was a little uneasy. Great hot water!
Well controlled AC/Heat system. For no charge, they brought a small refrigerator/microwave unit into the room for us to use. Very polite an helpful staff. Excellent complimentary breakfast to 10 AM! Some variety of scrambled eggs or omelets, breakfast meat, make your own waffles, toast, danish, fresh fruit, juices, dry cereal, milk, coffee and tea. Hot drink bar open most of the time near main desk. Excellent fresh cookies near main desk in afternoon! We had a room facing the hi-way, but the noise level was very acceptable. The only faults I could report on was the very hilly parking lots and the small refrigerator they brought us did not have a temperature control and anything we put in it froze.", April 2016, Traveled as a couple, The quieter rooms would be on the side facing the hill,5,4,4,,,4,,,

Every Hilton brand hotel I have stayed in has been very good to excellent. Hilton has dropped the ball on this hotel. I arrived at 9:00 p.m. carrying my 2 year old daughter because she was sleeping, my husband went to look for parking because it's a weird set up at the entrance. The car barely fit the entrance. As I approached the front desk the customer service rep was looking at us as if we didn't belong there as if black people were not allowed there. She was extremely rude. She asked for my credit card and identification so she could charge my card that night. I was not aware of this new policy of Hilton charging your card when you arrive. I asked her can she please give me my key and let me get my SLEEPING daughter situated and I would come down and pay. This was not an option she told me no, you have to pay right now. I made her aware that I have NEVER paid for a room when I check in its paid for when I check out. My husband was carrying all of our bags because there were no baggage helpers or carts. I had to wake my daughter up and make sure she did not fall while I stood her up so I could get my wallet. When I retrieved my credit card and badge then she seemed like she was a little at ease. At this point the manager walked out and told me this was their policy. I asked for his name and told him they I would contact I get in the elevator and the first thing I noticed was how dirty the carpet in the elevator was. We get in our room and the carpet in there was FILTHY. The room smelled like someone smoked 1000 cigarettes in an hour in there. The bed sheets were dingy and wrinkled. The sofa was disgusting, the remote had fingerprints all over it and the bathroom had feces in the toilet. I was three seconds from checking out but decided to rough it out because it was late. I immediately called the Hilton 24 hour 800 number and spoke with a guest relations specialist. I let her know everything up to that point. Check out is suppose to be at 11:00 a.m. and at 8:30 a.m. we had housekeeping BANGING on our door 3 or 4 times. My husband jumped from his sleep and managed to tell them that check out is not until 11. At 10:00 housekeeping came again banging asking us if were checking out today.

The Hampton Inn offers a reasonably priced stay in a property that is generally clean. You always know what to expect in the Hampton Inn, so if something is out of place then you can just point it out and they will take care of it.

If you're not familiar with the area and don't have a map or GPS with you, you might check directions ahead of time. The hotel is located in Elmsford yet they call label themselves in White Plains and Tarrytown in their name. That does not make sense! Those are completely different towns and cities!! So for those who do not know this area, I can see how you might get off the wrong exit and spin yourself in circles trying to find it.

Breakfast is good, but can get crowded around primetime -- e.g. 8am to 9am. Around the clock coffee and hot chocolate is nice. Internet wifi is also always available at a good speed.

Whenever I travel for business I usually head for the nearest hilton. I will say this place is good for a night or two if you need to be in the area. After two nights I'm switching over to the hotel next door for the rest of my week. When I first checked in there was a bag of trash in front of my room. Understanding someone may have forgotten it or was making another trip I didn't mind. That evening the bag had somehow come closer to my room and the hallway smelt. I told the front desk and they took care of it by the time I returned from dinner. When I exited the second floor to the parking lot I felt uneasy. (dim lights, pool construction, empty area with the occasional smoker) I returned and parked in the lots below where there is more lighting. The next day my room wasn't serviced, which I understand sometimes it happens. I just asked for clean towels which were brought up but when I went to take a shower I found a long hair folded within the towel. There is road noise if you have a room facing the highway (makes sense bc you're right next to it) and the fridge hums throughout the night with a buzz every 20 seconds. It's not noticeable until you're trying to sleep. With the fridge 3 feet from the head of the bed it irritating. What finally got me was when I went to reheat some leftovers in the microwave the cord didn't reach an outlet. I had to put the microwave on the ground to plug it in.

Bed was comforable. The air conditioner was not too loud and positioned so not to blow air into your face when in bed, it was on the desk side of the room. I appreciated that. The hotel is in general need of repairs and needs to be updated. Our bathroom ceiling had black mold spots on it and a couple tiles were broken. Amenities in the room included; internet, cable flat screen TV, small refrigerator, small microwave, iron and full size ironing board, hair dryer and of course phone and clock. Our room was 606, it faced out onto the very steep wooded hill behind the hotel, which gave the room a feeling of seclusion. Speaking of the hill, the entire hotel is perched on a very steep hill, in fact it is more like a small mountain. You have to zigzag up two levels from road level to get to the front lobby. Be prepared to carry your luggage up 5 steps to get into the lobby or take the very long ramp from the parking lot. All three parking lots are perched into the steep hill. Complimentary breakfast was fair, offering two types of eggs, sausage, waffles, yogurt, fruit, juices, pastries and cereals. The location of the hotel is perfect to visit Tarrytown and Sleepy Hollow which are less than 10-15 minutes away. Lyndhurst Castle, Equus at Castle on the Hudson, Kykuit (the Rockefeller Estate), Philipsburg Manor, Washington Irving's Sunnyside, Union Church, Sleepy Hollow Cemetery at Old Dutch Church and many more attractions are all within 15-20 minutes drive of the Hampton Inn at Elmsford. After speaking to the manager I was happy to learn that the hotel has new owners. Renovation plans are in place to begin in October 2015 with the entire hotel, pool and rooms being updated by November 2016.
Now for the warning: the day after Labor Day was move-in day for the upper classmen of Mercy College. Yes, the hotel rents out most of floors 4, 5 and 6 to the college to use as dorms! BTW this is also true of the Double Tree Inn down the road from the Hampton Inn. Tuesday , 9-8-15, the hotel was in total turmoil. The lobby was filled with frenzied commotion of college students moving in with huge orange moving bins on wheels. It was impossible to get a free elevator. We were forced to use the back stairs. We are in our 60s so going up 6 flights of stairs several times was an inconvenience. Although, the students were very courteous we were unwilling to deal with this move-in event. We checked out the next day, 2 days earlier than planned. I would recommend this hotel for the summer months due to its great location but steer clear during college move-in and move-out dates.", September 2015, Traveled as a couple," Dorm rooms are on the 4, 5 and 6 floors pick floors 1 and 2.

I got the room next to my room with a broken lock. I was never told that she was sorry for any inconvenience that this may be causing. I was never asked (I am in my 60s)if I might need help moving.

My most recent (August 2015) stay was the worst yet. This Hampton was re-done (not renovated) about 5 years ago, and as they say, ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig"". The good: I had a nice-looking, nicely appointed queen room with a roll-in shower, which is something I require for mobility and safety. The not so good: there was a crying baby in the adjoining room next door; screaming at midnight and then again on Sunday morning at 5 a.m. Well, that made for a wonderful night's rest! The bad: The toilet was constantly running, all night long; making noise and wasting water as well. But wait, unknown to me THE WORST was yet to come. On Sunday morning, there was absolutely No HOT WATER in the shower. I let it run for a good 12-15 minutes, thinking that the hot water needed to make its way up the hill and to my 2nd floor room. With no other alternative, I chose to take my own ""ice bucket challenge"" and so I toughed my way through a totally COLD shower. Note to self: You can't shampoo with cold water! So I wasted no time checking out, and after explaining these problems to the lady at the front desk, she apologized and promptly adjusted my account. To be fair, I understand the randomness of a screaming baby in the room next to me; and I understand that hotel toilets get a lot of use, and parts in the tank can wear out. But there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for not having hot water for a shower! I'm a Hilton Honors Gold-level member, so I'm loyal to the Hilton chain. But as convenient and friendly as this Hampton Inn is, I will not stay here again. You'll find me at the nearby Doubletree in Tarrytown...it's more money, but well worth it for a quiet night's stay with a working toilet & hot water for my morning shower.", August 2015, Traveled solo,none,2,,,,2,2,2,,

Our room had an aged feel to it. There was no micowave or mini fridge in the room which was a bit of a disappointment. We stayed here for 4 nights and used it as a base to visit N.Y.C..They do have a complimentary shuttle going to the Tarrytown Metro North Station. The shuttle runs from 7:00am to 10:00am mornings and from 5:00pm to 10:00pm evenings. If you are arriving late in the evening, you have to keep a sharp eye out, as the enterance is not well lit. They only have a small 1 foot square sign lit up, which is very difficult to see. A note to the management: Shine a light on the large Hampton Inn sign by the entrance, so people can see where to enter. Overall the room was smallish, nothing special, but comfortable. The breakfast was very good with a nice variety of the usual fare, and had a very roomy and comfortable area to dine in. It was reasonably priced, compared to others in the N.Y. area, but make sure to reserve ahead to get a cheaper rate. The hotel only has an outside pool which is not heated and didn't look very inviting, so we passed on using it. I know people complain about this hotel being on a hill,but we found that it wasn't a problem. You can load and unload at the front door and walk up about 6 steps to the lobby.

We had three nights booked at this property around two nights at the Castle Hotel & Spa nearby. One night at this property was WAY too much. We cancelled the remaining two nights and opted for two more nights at the Castle. So, you ask, what was so bad about the Hampton Inn? Glad you asked:
1. Loading and unloading was extremely difficult. There's a narrow drive with 10 steps up to the registration area and NO ONE to assist with bags. I eventually found a handicap parking spot that I could get a luggage cart to via a long, sloped ramp to with no small amount of difficulty.
2. No microwave and no refrigerator in the room. There's a dusty spot on the carpet where I assume one should or was located but nothing's there. A call to the front desk elicits a ""we'll send someone up"".
3. No extra blanket in the closet that we expect to be there (in plastic). Same call. Same response.
4. There's no dresser in the room! Better than that, there aren't any drawers because there aren't any dressers or night stands! The TV is on a 8"" deep shelving unit that barely held the ice bucket.
5. No stand(s) to put the two suitcases on so we could at least take a few things out of them without crawling around on the floor. Yep. Called the desk. Yep. ""We'll send someone up"".
6. The hallway and room carpeting were FILTHY! Dusty and dirty. My white socks may never be white again.
7. The Double queen room is the smallest Hampton double room I've been in in years.
8. According to the write-up, we should have received a morning paper at the door. Not so much. Really didn't expect it but one can always hope.
9. Breakfast was probably the last straw. Nothing really worked well there either. Oatmeal was lukewarm. One, 4 slice toaster with one side not working and the other only half working. Counters were dirty.

When the staff person cam to the room after a half hour or so and I answered the door I was greeted with ""What did you want?"". Now, that's the kind of service I'm looking for! He eventually wheeled in a tiny, tiny refrigerator and and equally small microwave from the room next to us (wonder what they were going to do?). It was completely frozen solid with ice! I didn't even bother. Later, when we went out for dinner, I found the luggage rack leaning against the wall outside the door.

The best part of the stay here was after breakfast when I went to inform the desk I was checking out and canceling the remaining reservations. The very polite and sweet receptionist if everything was OK and I chose not to respond. She looked up, figured out immediately what the answer was and offered an explanation that the entire property was long overdue for a renovation.

She is SO right.

With that in mind, I don't plan on returning to this hotel. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I try to be as fair and give positive comments as often as possible.

The hotel sits on a steep hill. Parking can be challenging but it is well lighted and marked.

Upon check-in, the computer systems were down so it took about 15 minutes to get checked in. While I understand that computer systems go down, the staff did a lot of standing around waiting on a Manager to check guests in.

The hotel is a older hotel that should be renovated soon. It's not a dirty hotel. The room was clean enough but that's where my complaint comes in.

I had no hot water at the bathroom sink. I called the Front Desk and they sent maintenance up to the room. After a couple of trips, a bunch of noise, and lots of running water, the Maintenance person declared the water problems fixed. I went to check the water and I've sprayed water from a straw with more pressure than what was coming from the faucet.

I stated that it was not fixed and he said that's all he could do and left. So I'm stuck starting at a sink that is barely dripping water and it is not hot. It's barely warm! It took more than 1.5 minutes to fill the bathroom cup of water.

I looked at the faucet myself and it needs to be replaced. I checked the room next door and they had decent water pressure. I had 2 rooms overall and the other room had fine water pressure.

I didn't sleep well as the AC was very finicky. The gap between the door and the floor was big enough to let all of the hallway lights in at night, so I ended up sticking a towel in front of the door to block out the light.

To wrap this up, I just think it's time to renovate. Update the rooms. Replace the faucets. If the Maintenance person can't fix an issue, then bring in a professional plumber. For the rates charged for the night, I was unhappy. I spent a lot of money based on the name of the hotel. I should have booked a room elsewhere.", August 2015, Traveled on business,none,2,,2,,2,2,,,

It was up and down--at times I wondered how I would rate the place. In the end, there were as many downs as ups.

So let's start with the bad and end with the good. The worst thing about this place is its architecture. Now, OK, the New York City area is both blessed and cursed by its bedrock, and some buildings have to adapt to the hills. This is one that had a lot of adapting to do, and I joked that driving up their multiple tiers of parking felt like driving in the Swiss Alps. But whoever designed this building made a fundamental gaffe; they put the entry drive eight steps below the front door. That means that, to load and unload, you either need to schlep your stuff up the steps, or pilot a luggage cart around a ramp that goes to the side. The ramp is not enclosed, and I had to roll through a steady rain to unload the trunk. There's no reason for it to be this way--the Rsidence Inn next door has an entry drive that's level with its front door, and it's built against the same hill. If there's a hailstorm or heavy snow, the ramp would be brutal to use, especially for peoplel who must go in a wheelchair (is this an ADA compliance issue?). Hampton Inn--enclose this ramp so that people can get inside dry and comfy regardless of the elements.

Now, there are some other issues. Construction of the place was a little shoddy; floors in the room were uneven. The little outdoor pool, which I did not use (it was a chilly week), looked a bit too algae-green for my taste. Maintenance seems to be an issue; the room was standard motel quality but the smoke alarm was hanging out of the wall by its wiring. During our stay, they had to shut off the water for about four hours one night (they claimed it was a city issue, but the repair was happening in their front drive, 20 feet from the entrance); TV service failed one morning; two of the three treadmills in the workout room went on the fritz. There was even a momentary power glitch during the water repair. One of the elevators, while I'm sure it was not dangerous, shook and shuddered discomfitingly when it got above the fifth floor. The furniture in our room was strange--it seemed mismatched, there was almost no drawer space, the TV could have been located closer to the sofa-bed (which we only used as a sofa) rather than sqared up to the king bed--I think more people watch before bedtime more than during. While there's room for a microwave above the mini-fridge, our room didn't have one--we were told some are available and they might move one into our room, but we never saw it, and it would have given us some options.

And, like many hotels now, things get pricey. One night, in partial desperation, I bought a snack bar and a little bag of snack mix from their small pantry--total cost, six dollars. Seems outrageous to me, I must remember to pack my own snacks.

Now, could Hilton communicate better when reserving on its website? This hotel permits smoking, and I'm a bit allergic--happily, us being put on the smoking floor did not become a problem, but why wasn't that made clear on the website? Like many hoteliers, they now use infometrics to change room prices nightly according to their projected demand, and that's OK--but why does the website show you only the lowest one-night rate instead of listing all of them when you reserve? Inexcusable laziness on the part of their web programmers.

And a final quibble; there's nothing but paper cups available. Those work well for coffee and tea and OK for water, but if you want to drink any adult beverages you might want to pop over to your discount store and buy some high-quality plastic to pack on your trip.

OK, now the upside. Some of what they do, they do quite well. First on the list; free breakfast, and not just sweet rolls and coffee. Their breakfast bar rotates western and cheese omelets, scrambled eggs, pork and turkey sausage, french toast strips, and ""bagel toppers"" which in actuality seem to be English muffins with egg and meat cooked on them. It doesn't stop there; there's a make-your-own waffle station (suggestion: put out some Hershey's syrup to go with the whipped cream?), oatmeal, cold cereal, a good range of pastries, and fresh fruit--which in this case was supremes of orange, pineapple slices, and cantaloupe slices that I did not expect to be so perfectly ripe this early in the season. Now, a little attention to detail by the staff is possible--the all-day coffee/tea concession in the lobby ran out of cups (and yes, the desk staff was quick to amend), and the rich variety of teabags seen at breakfast doesn't seem to be normal in the lobby for no good reason. But the food was a big plus in their favor.

The other thing that impressed me; the toiletries. Their little bottles of hair products (plus bath gel!) and bars of soap are Neutrogena brand, which means they're paying for a top-quality product for your morning shower.

The hotel staff was unfailingly friendly. I think most of the disappointments I experienced during this stay are the fault of the parent company and not the local team. Nonetheless, I'm hoping that in the future we can plan to book our Westchester County stay somewhere else.", June 2015, Traveled as a couple," If you get a room in the rear, the hillside view out of your window will be delightful.",3,2,2,,,2,,,

The over all experience was absolutely horrible. The bathroom looks like a blind carpenter did the repairs to the grout. The tv did not work and i called multiple times to have it repaired. We were forced to switch rooms when they could not repair the TV for the third day in a row(refused to offer any compensation.) The worst part is that they double billed both my girlfriend and i for our stay. I have called multiple times to get this issue resolved and no one is willing to help correct the problem. They charged my card with 5 separate charged totaling over 400 and my girlfriends card 5 times for over 500. We have sent them credit card authorization forms multiple times for the correct card to no avail. The charges that they have processed do not match an no one can explain the amounts to me. (ranges from $22 to $350) The parking lot was also horrendous it was not plowed properly and is on an incredibly steep hill. I had to have another guest help push my car up the hill to get into a parking spot.

Checked in and things were explained on bill which is what Expedia stated, but the hotel does hold a $50 refundable fee when you check out. ( This covers any costs in room incurred like movies, food, etc.)

Room we stayed in was comfortable and clean. A/C was great!! Room service was quick when we requested extra towels. Staff at front desk was polite and professional and the shuttle driver was courteous and friendly.

They do provide a shuttle bus to Tarrytown or White Plains train station.Last shuttle pickup is at 10 pm, so you'll need a taxi back to hotel after 10pm. It cost us $14 from Tarrytown train station back to hotel.

**NOTE to travelers: We took the train to Grand Central Station (42nd Street) and the express train takes about 30 minutes, but the local train is close to an hour. You have to check schedule at train station, and it does not specify which one will be local or express. Hotel does not have train schedules. The train from Tarrytown stops at Yankee Stadium. :)

The hotel provides breakfast in the morning, but you have to be patient as it's a little hectic when other patrons are trying to get the food too. Either go down early or wait patiently.

Biggest selling point for me: NON-SMOKING HOTEL. Fantastic if you don't like stinky places from stinky smokers. However, there are still people who throw their cigarettes on the ground which makes the hotel look unclean.
Note to smokers: Be respectful and don't throw your trash/cigarette butts on the ground!

Everyday they told me to let the water run for 10 min. Didn't work. The water was barely lukewarm. The second week I moved to another room with hot water, but had no heat. The third week I had hot water and heat sometimes. The fourth week I managed to have both until the heating unit went out and I was moved to another room. This week, the hotel notified us that the water would be off from 12-6 on a Friday due to a water meter problem. The water was restored 24 hours later (Saturday morning and it was brown when it ran out of the faucet). On top of that, there was no HOT water and now, Monday, FOUR days later, we are STILL without hot water. Everyday we have been told the water problem will be fixed today but it has yet to happen. The hotel has been shuttling guests over to another hotel to take a shower (who wants to do that?) When new guest arrive with reservations, they are told about the hot water problem with an apology. The guests are incredulous that they have just arrived, only to be told they cannot take a shower. It is a nightmare and really sad because the staff is so nice.

I was planning on staying by myself while he was hospitalized. We ended staying 7 days.
We arrived early (11am) hoping that we would be able to check in, so that he could do the prep that needed to be done the day before his surgery. They were able to accommodate us without a problem. The room was clean and located in the back of the property facing the hillside.(I had asked for a quiet room, and it was). The TV was a flat screen, and there were enough stations to keep us distracted.
I asked the front desk for suggestions regarding places to eat and suggestions and directions were quickly given. Parking was available but it is on a hillside so the parking was on several different levels.
We did not use the outdoor pool, but I was surprised to see they had a lifeguard on duty, although there was a sign saying swim at your own risk. The fitness center had working equipment and was clean. There was an area with coffee and tea in the lobby, and I, along with may of the other people who were staying here, took advantage of it. There were fresh baked cookies available each afternoon as well.
The breakfast everyday was a little different, but hot and tasty, along with pastries, cereal and fresh fruit. I noticed that the staff kept the area clean ad refreshed items as they were used, as well as offering towelettes and breath mints. There were also breakfast to go which I did use as I ran to the hospital.
The most amazing part of this trip was the compassion the staff had for us. I was asked each day how he was doing, was he out of ICU yet, and was told that they were praying for him. This may not mean much in the way of a review of the hotel, but it tells me a lot about the quality of the staff that they employed. This was not just 1 or 2 staff members but at least 5-6 people.
I would like to say a special thank you to the manager Shawn Holland and a staff member, Clyde who was especially comforting when I was feeling pretty upset.

We also had our car scraped in the parking lot and when I reported it to the front desk, two staffers told me their cars had also been scraped. The walkway from the parking lot to the hotel is very shabby, neglected, with broken pavement and exposed plaster. The hotel manager pretended she didn't know there was a pothole. etc. We have added costs of $775 resulting from our stay here on a Travelzoo voucher. Travelzoo apparently failed to inspect the property or else they seemingly don't care. I had originally written a more favorable review but after the bad attitudes of both the hotel and Travelzoo and the huge damage costs, I need to revise it. Some of the help don't understand English. The maid took all the towels off the hooks despite signs saying to put those to be changed on the floor. At breakfast a lady came around with a basket offering ""honey whites."" After not understanding several times, I picked up the packet and it said handi-wipes. The pool was too small and odd-shaped to swim in.

There was gum in the A/C unit, the cable jack was falling out of the wall, there was a weird substance on the back of the bathroom door, and instead of changing out the window curtain to cover up a stain, they pinned it together. Also my wife and I ordered a movie on Saturday night and every 10 minutes an ad would pop up on the screen. After an hour it was so annoying we stopped watching and I called the front desk to complain. The woman that answered made it seem like I was the problem and said ""I will take it off your bill this time but you have been watching it for an hour"". Very rude. I called back to talk to the manager and I was transferred back to this woman. She stated she was the Front Desk Supervisor. I asked to speak with her boss and she said he wasn't in until 11pm. Usually Hampton Inn's have good if not great service and they didn't live up to my history with them.
GOOD: Bed was comforatable and our room had a couch and microwave/fridge unit. Hotel was quiet and breakfast was good. Easy access off the highway and easy access into The Bronx.

Plenty of amenities, extra towels always at hand, microwaves and fridges available at no charge and the piece de resistence they wash all the blankets and duvet covers for every new guest. I cringe when I go to some hotels and think of the germs left on the spreads and comforters. My mind was at ease. Free breakfast was available from 6-10 AM with everything from Belgium waffles, yogurt, prepared oatmeal, cold cereal, fesh fruit, hard boiled eggs,etc. And there is a breakfast room attendant who walks around with mints and towelettes for the guests. they do not have their own restaurant but there are plenty in the immediate area and many who deliver to the hotel. It is not a huge hotel but they go all out to accomodate you whether you are there for business or pleasure. The accomodations are modern and the common areas are sleek, comfortable and clean.

A hot breakfast is provided daily but no other food service is really available at the hotel. There are several small restaurants and delivery services available and they are listed in the rooms.
The location is rather isolated but it is ""on top"" of the major highways that intersect at this location. Compared to other hotels in the White Plains, NY area - this one has a very reasonable price.
One recommendation that applies here (and for all hotel reservations), check on-line for your best deal. I booked thru ""booking"" wed site and got a good deal. But I later found out the hotel offered a government rate - but I could not change it upon arrival since I did not book directly with the hotel. So cehck the various booking web sites (I usually google the location and serach ""nearby"" hotels - but I failed to check with the hotel directly. So a good habit to get into os to compare prices on-line - and then call the hotel direct and see if they can beat the offer. It will also give you a hint of the service as to how they speak to you - a potential guest.
If you do stay here - ask for an ""even nuber room"" which will put you on the back side of the hotel away from the busy freeway in the front.
The hotel is very nice - steep entrance and parking - would be difficult if icy or snow - but other than that - a solid hotel when passing thru or working in nearby White Plains.

Only living an hour away, I didn't think I'd spend the night. When I left at 10 it was snowing hard, visibility was bad and roads covered. I didn't want to go back to the Ritz Carlton and spend $350 a night so I drove slowly out of White Plains. I was getting lost and although I could put Highway 287 in my navigation, I was afraid to go over the Tapan Zee bridge. So, I searched for any brand-name hotel and the Hampton Inn was the first I found.

There was no available spots in the first tier lot so I had to go up a hill to a back lot. I hoped first there would be vacancy, and second that the snow would be plowed in the morning because I worried about the hill going down.

I was greeted warmly in the lobby by a lovely young woman, Zena who told me they did indeed have vacancy and she worked to find me the best rate. She asked if I was a Hilton Hhonors member, and I recalled signing up someplace and was glad since that was a better rate. I paid $115 and although it wasn't cheap, it was better than the Ritz Carlton and I wasn't going back out. I made a hot tea in the lobby, went up to my clean (small) room, took a warm bath, then watched TV comfy-cozy.

The storm was worse in the morning, but the hotel was well-staffed. The complimentary breakfast was nice especially the mini omelettes and fresh fruit. There was a very nice attendant who passed out mints and moist towelettes. I'm sorry I didn't get her name for this review.

I waited as long as possible to check out and the roads sanded.

The staff is very friendly and mostly helpful. My HiltonHonors status wasn't mentioned, but that's not a big deal. The lobby and rooms are nice and in good condition.

My major issue was with the temperature control in the rooms. I arrived late on the 1st night and the extremely warm air hit me as I walked in my room. The temperature was 78 with the heat running. I changed the setting to cool and dropped the set temperature to 69 degrees to try to cool it down. Since it was late I went to bed expecting the room to cool down. I woke on top of my covers and found the room to only be 2 degrees cooler. On my way out that morning I asked what I could do as I could not sleep in such a warm room. The lady at the front desk pulled out a letter explaining the heating/cooling system & said I should have received it at checkin (did not receive it). She said that the letter stated that if you had trouble to contact the front desk to have them put your system on manual control. She said she'd have maintenance do that while I was out for the day.

When I came in that evening, the heat was blasting on high and the room was 86 degrees. Front desk sent maintenance, but he couldn't get it to a point where it would cool off. The person at the front moved my room at the suggestion of maintenance. I was already in my pajamas (much cooler than the sweater I was wearing when I got back to the room) so I packed up my things and moved rooms. While in the elevator a lady told me her room was so cold & wouldn't warm up. The new room was cool, but stayed at a constant temperature and I was able to sleep under the covers.

When checking out I stopped at the front desk to suggest getting the temperature control system fixed and was told he'd mention it. I explained that it was a frustrating experience to have an unpleasant sleep one night and then have to move rooms the next. He said that he was there and did me a courtesy of moving my room. Not even an apology for the situation--just that he took care of it by moving me.", February 2013, Traveled on business, If you're room is severly warm at check-in contact the front desk immediately.

We had a total of five rooms for approximately two to four nights. My husband and I were paying for our photographers room as well as our own (each room 3 nights each). When we arrived I explained to the very helpful front desk staff that we would be paying for both rooms and we wanted to pay cash upon check out. They said it wouldn't be a problem but that we had to secure each room with a credit card for ""incidentals"". We were ok with that. When my photographer checked out on Monday, we paid cash for her room and did not have a problem. The following Wednesday my husband and I checked out. When we got to the front desk, the gentleman had told us that the room had already been charged to our card. I explained that we had stated we wanted to pay cash for the room (so not to incur another wedding bill). He said it wouldn't be a problem; that he would reverse the charge and apply the cash. He folded our receipt in three and fastened it closed with a sticker that said ""Hampton Inn"". He said we were all set and that we may see a charge on the card but within a couple days we would also see a credit and that if there was any problems, to give them a call back and they would take care of it. Sounds very nice right? Good service...polite staff...two days later my husband and I left for our honeymoon for two weeks and when we got back, we were busy moving me to Buffalo (a 400 mile move).
Well, fast forward a few weeks. About two weeks ago my husband got his credit card statement and low and behold, the charge for the Hampton Inn was still there. I immediately picked up the phone and called. I explained to the young lady that answered the phone our situation. She told me that she saw that we had paid cash for the one room but that for our room, she was only seeing the credit card payment. I was so upset. I told her I would call back once I found our receipt. After searching through some boxes that had yet to be unpacked, I found the receipt. When I unfastened it (YES, I made the mistake of not checking the receipt when we left the hotel - we were in a hurry to get my husband's mom to the airport), to my utter surprise the receipt reflected the charge card and not the cash. I called back the hotel and asked for the general manager's voicemail. I was forwarded to Michelle's voicemail. Two voicemails and two days later I got a call back. She was very nice. I explained my situation and even told her who had helped us. She told me she would look into it, speak to the individual and call me back the next day. This was Tuesday. Friday I had to call her again because I had not heard back. At that point she had herself, the front desk mgr and the gentleman in the room. He stated that he remembered me giving him a credit card to pay with. I told her with all due respect, you have a liar and a thief working for your organization. At that point she agreed that she would have her other manager go back and review the security tapes to see what they showed. I thanked her and asked when I could expect to hear back. She said Monday. The following Tuesday when I didn't hear back, I called her AGAIN and left two voicemails. Upon my second voicemail I told her that I was in town visiting and that if I didn't hear from her first thing Weds. morning, I would be in to take care of this in person. I also told her that it is extremely unprofessional as a manager to say you are going to return a customer's call by a certain date and time and then NEVER fulfill that promise. Sure enough, first thing Wednesday morning I received a call from her. She left a voice mail as I was out having breakfast with my grandmother. The voicemail said that she was sorry she didn't get back to me sooner but they were having ""technical difficulty"" with the video equipment....and that unfortunately she couldn't find the video for the date in question...that it didn't exist anymore.
At this point I'm fuming! I intend to go to Hampton Inn's Corporate office and I will not rest until I get some restitution.

Stayed for five nights in June 2012. I travel weekly for work and as a diamond HHonors member try to stay at a Hampton Inn or comparable Hilton property. First the positives -- it is clean, has a very nice breakfast area and a workout room that is well above the Hampton Inn average.

That said this location is noticeably older has some serious drawbacks. The location is on a hill and the parking is below the entryway. Be ready to climb some stairs. Being that the property is also wedged between a couple highways expect to hear traffic noise at all hours of the day. This wouldn't be such a big issue but the in-room HVAC fan cannot be set to run at night to give a bit of white noise and dampen the sound of semis. During my stay I also had a room attendant come in and clean my room despite the do not disturb sign being up.

But, in my opinion, the lack of good internet is the most glaring failure of this location. Forget watching Netflix or streaming video of any sort. It took me back to the days of dial-up.

I guess I just come to expect a little more at a Hamton as compared to the competition. Two issues here; one they can't do a thing about and the other would be an easy fix.
The first is the location. The place is built into the side of a mountain and it's not easy dragging your luggage, work bag and suit bag up a steep set of stairs from the parking lot to the front door.
That is what it is. But if you can stay just down the street at a competitor and not have to do that then....
The second thing is the abysmal lack of TV channels available. They have DIsh Network as their TV provider and therefore no Yankee's games (Dish doesn't carry the YES network). A hotel located 15 miles north of NYC and no Yankees ? Wow !! Only like 15 channels. That may not be a big deal to some but what does one do at night in a hotel ?

They keep the property clean and the breakfast area well maintained.

I was a bit concerned the property is built into a hillside so that the lower parking has a very steep set of steps to climb to get to the hotel entrance. Upper parking is layered into the hill making it awkward to carry luggage on an incline.

The room was typical, tastefully appointed, and the bed (mattress, pillows, sheets) always very comfortable. What I didn't like was the bathroom. When wide open the door nearly touches the front of the toilet. To step completely inside the bathroom requires maneuvering against the sink and along the side of the toilet to close the door. The tub was narrow reducing elbow room when turning around. Given the size of the bedroom area the architects could have moved a wall to accommodate a more spacious and convenient bathroom.

This review is going to be quite extensive, so if you want to save time, skip down to ---THE BREAKDOWN--- for a much more succinct review.

First off, the Hampton Inn White Plains/Tarrytown is a lower-end hotel about 3 miles east of Tarrytwon NY. I say lower-end in that it’s well above any motel, but still a ways from a Hilton or Marriot. Despite that, this particular hotel is definitely not a no-frills place. I knew that coming in, and was still happily surprised by what was offered. The location is reasonably good, right along White Plains Rd, a main thoroughfare and within very good distance of several small towns and a short train ride from New York City. Being near a business park, it is also great for those staying in the area on business, which I myself was not. The hotel is situated on a small hill and the parking lot seems like it would be tough to negotiate in the winter. If possible, I suggest sticking with public transportation, which is widely available and affordable if you plan ahead. If you do, I strongly suggest keeping some cash on hand for the occasional taxi ride.
The hotel itself is nicely designed. I visited in January of 2012, and so I wasn’t able to see the pool, but every other amenity was available. The area in front of the entrance is nicely designed, but the stairs in front make it a little difficult if you have a large or heavy bag. The wheelchair ramp is off to the side and slightly inconvenient, but not especially so. The lobby is of a basic, modern design and throughout my stay, was immaculate. The only time I was able to find a stain was when I actively looked for one, and even then it was difficult. The check-in process was quick, without seeming rushed and the staff was very friendly and accommodating, a trend that continued throughout my time there.
The lobby had a small self-serve coffee bar that was available at all hours of the day, as opposed to just early in the morning. The lounge area is adjacent to the main lobby and has several padded chairs and couches, a few televisions and a few tables for use during the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast is available from 6am to 10am and is substantial for being complimentary. Additionally, the available food does change somewhat from day to day, which was a very pleasant surprise. Right next to the front desk is a small, but well stocked store with snack foods, microwavable meals and basic sundries. It’s worth noting that a lot of basic needs items are also available for free at the front desk too.
A small gym is available on the first floor and is very well equipped with both cardio machines and a small weight rack. The gym also has several televisions, including a few installed in the treadmills and headphones for privacy while watching. The hotel also has a few conference rooms which were often in use, but of which I didn’t get to see much. A small business center with one computer and a fax/printer was in the main lobby area which was particularly convenient, but with only one computer could be problematic.
The room I stayed in was nice, very clean and fresh smelling. The only notable issue was that the room had no drawers or cabinetry, with the exception of the nightstands. There is a closet and a shelf at the top of the closet, but for those who like to thoroughly unpack, it could be difficult. Another lacking issue was that none of the rooms have either a refrigerator or microwave, which would have been of great convenience. A microwave is available downstairs in the lobby convenience store though. The bedding was pristine and the furnishings were clean and in good condition. The television was quite new and offered a wide variety of audio/visual hookups including VGA input for computer connections. The rooms also came with a lap-desk which actually ended up being very useful in my case.
The only aspect of the hotel that I was particularly upsetting was the internet access. I personally like to bring my own Cat 5 chord because LAN connections are generally less problematic. However, this hotel doesn’t offer LAN connections in their rooms. The wireless access for me was a bit of a problem (though I’m sure it was an issue on my part), and so I opted for the free wireless adapter available from the front desk. The kind available was big and bulky and generally kind of annoying. The adapter worked well enough though. The internet speed was kind of slow for me throughout the trip, but that may have been due to high bandwidth use since the hotel was heavily occupied at the time. In all, the issue was just an annoyance at worst and still worked for me as well as I needed.
As mentioned before, the hotel offers a very substantial and complimentary breakfast, but aside from the small snack store, there is no real dining options within the hotel itself. The general area is littered with great places to eat and the majority of places offer delivery options. However, the only restaurant that is especially close is a small diner called The Eldorado Diner, about a quarter mile down the street. The Eldorado is a standard 24-hour diner with a wide variety of food and very reasonable prices. Additionally, there’s a list of local restaurants in the information binder (though during my stay, it was a bit out-of-date).

---THE BREAKDOWN---
I’ve stayed in the area three times in recent history and this was by far my best experience. The location is good and allows for easy travel by public transport and (I assume) by car. The hotel itself is in fantastic condition and is kept very clean. All the staff I saw and spoke with were very friendly and helpful and even conversational. Several amenities make the stay more convenient and many of which are better than one would expect for a hotel of this price. Most certainly, more could be done and there are hotels that offer more conveniences, but for the price and the location, there are few if any hotels that I have seen that can beat this one. Final word, all things considered, quite possibly the best hotel experience I’ve ever had. If you’re used to higher-end hotels, you might be disappointed, but not necessarily. If you’re looking for a good, easy place to stay in the area, this is a great place for individuals or families.", January 2012, Traveled as a couple, View on the rear of the building isn't especially nice (unless it snows).,5,,5,5,5,5,5,,

Unfortunately, as we tried to depart on our last day, our car would not start -- the battery was dead. Tyler, who had checked us out at the front desk, changed hats (so to speak) and became more helpful than any concierge at a luxury hotel and offered to help jump start the car. Unfortunately, two cars were parked on either side of our vehicle, preventing us from getting close enough to jump start it, and I was not familiar with the safety feature on our car that prevented me from putting it into neutral. Tyler waited patiently as our car dealer walked us through how to pop out a piece of plastic and insert a screwdriver to manually override the safety feature and allow the car to be put into neutral. He provided the screwdriver to do so and then helped move the car so that we could jump the battery. And then Tyler drove his car next to ours and helped me jump the battery, thereby starting our car and allowing us to be on or way. I offered him a well-deserved tip and he refused, saying that something like this could happen to anyone.
In short, Tyler was extraordinarily helpful and very pleasant (even with three kids running around wanting to get in the car). I have no doubt that, should he wish to have a successful career in the hospitality industry, he will rise fast and go far.

We were seven families, a total of 25 people, 2 to 95 years old. We chose this Hampton Inn because it was about half way between Massachusetts and Maryland, and was close to New York City.
Our rooms each had two double beds and were spacious and nicely decorated. A small refrigerator can be requested at no charge. We received a good group rate for our rooms.
Friday night we had pizza and salads delivered from Capri Pizza and Pasta, 350 South Broadway, Tarrytown, NY .The pizza and salads were very good, especially the Margherita pizza. We had our pizza dinner in the guest common area.
A full buffet breakfast is included. The kids especially liked making their own waffles. In addition to the waffles, there were scrambled and boiled eggs, bacon, hot and cold cereals, fresh fruit, yogurt, breads, muffins, Danish, coffee/tea
On Saturday, most of the families went to NYC for the day.. They went to the White Plains station, though North White Plains would also work. It’s a 10 min drive to either stations, with paid parking available. It was a 40 min ride to Grand Central.
There are also many historical sites and Rye Playland near the hotel that we did not get to visit during this trip.
The outdoor swimming pool at the hotel was refreshing when the families returned from their day in the city. There are tables with umbrellas for those who want some shade.
There’s also a small well-equipped exercise room which some of our group used during our stay.

I have stayed here multiple times over the last 4-5 years and each stay is increasingly worse. First value? What value? $169.00 a night for a Hampton even close to a major city like New York is totally unreasonable for a discount chain. But you are kind of stuck if you have to come to this area for business as I do. It is either here, an Extended Stay America, or a Marriot. Neither of which is to desirable in my opinion. First of all the “creature comforts” at the property are not good. First thing is there is no dresser in the rooms!!! The only drawers where on the night stands; how do you have a hotel room and no place to put your stuff?!? For someone that is on the road approx 140 days a year I like to unpack all my clothing when I check in to make it feel a little more home like. That was just unacceptable. The cable is also undesirable for a business traveler. There is only like 14 channels and while the TV was a new flat screen none of the channels were in HD, which for someone that travels a lot, I really find important. The channels were all fuzzy and snowy except for the local ABC affiliate. The thing that drove me the most crazy was the hotel Had ESPN2, ESPNU (ESPN University), ESPN Classic, and ESPN News, but no Normal Regular ESPN! ESPNs accounted for roughly half the channels. The cable or satellite feed for the channel labeled as ESPN was showing ESPNU, I called the front desk and went down to the desk EVERYDAY during my stay and was give the same answer, “we will advise Maintenance of the issue”. I even gave them a detailed explanation of what was wrong and even said I could fix it in 2 seconds. The master box that distributes to the rooms was set wrong, all it would have take is to change the channel on the master box. They would not allow me to see the junction box where I could have done the fix, but no one at the Hotel fixed it or tried to appease me in anyway. I wanted ESPN for baseball, but I was stuck with Women’s College Softball or Lacrosse on ESPNU. This is just such an easy fix where me, and Im sure other Sports Fans, would have benefited. Also, what good is a nice flat screen if the stuff showing is of lousy quality, and on top of that there was no CW affiliate on the cable feed, it might not be the most popular network but it does show you local programming prior to the network programming, such as sitcom reruns and other things that are a nice way to unwind at the end of the day. I did not get a USA Today delivered to my door and one day they said they were out of them at 615am. Shouldn’t the property have enough to go around based on the amount of guests? It’s a small thing but after a day of work I find it comforting to sit down and read the news paper. The breakfast was sub-par and all they provided was “Light or Diet” yogurt. I am highly allergic to “NutraSweet” or Asppertaine which causes me migraines and a great deal of discomfort. I was unable to stay on my doctor approved diet based on what was available to me. These are just little things but after working 12 hour days they add up to an un-enjoyable experience at this property.
I did contact Hilton Honors in reference to my stay and the manager did contact and me and give me a credit for one night of my stay and he was detailed in is explanation on why things could not be fixed to my liking but it was an overall customer service issue, if the hotel staff would have given me HALF the explanation the property manager did I would have been so much more satisfied. I know I will have to stay there again come November and I hope to report a much more positive stay.

I spent some time reading reviews, and this hotel was as advertised! Great find for the price. I called other hotels in the area with similar star ratings (and worse customer ratings), and the prices were actually higher.

The lobby, which was renovated last year, was very clean and inviting. The woman who assisted us at the front desk, Julia, was AMAZING. We had a few requests with rooms/floor preference, and she was extremely accommodating. She also engaged us in brief conversation since we checked in later (no lines). JetBlue has lost one of the girl's baggage, so Julia was wonderful with toiletries.

The rooms were spacious and clean. My only complaint would be the sheets, which were a little rough. I've stayed at many Hampton Inns, and this was definitely one of the better ones in terms of decor and ambiance.

The complimentary breakfast (which included a full array of tea & coffee) was pretty good! We didn’t arrive until 9:45 (it ends at 10 AM), so it was a little picked over at that point.

We felt this property had some very positive points, but a few negatives as well.

Location: The hotel is extremely convenient to I-287's Exit 1, with southbound and northbound on-ramps and off-ramps all within about 100 yards of the hotel driveways. The hotel is built into the side of a hill, making parking and access somewhat confusing compared to some other Hampton's. Getting from the street to the front door for check-in requires two 180-degree turns up the switchback-style driveway. Except for a dozen or so spots on the same level as the front entrance, parking is either a full flight of stairs below the entrance level , or in one of a series of terraced-lots built into the hillside above one side of the building. Once at the entrance, getting from your car to the front door requires climbing eight or nine steps (not easy with full suitcases and other luggage) or using a ramp which extends around the side of the building and ends at a steeply sloped driveway -- in other words, no level spot to put a luggage cart while you unload.

Exterior: There is an outdoor pool area, which was closed for the season during our visit. If you have one of the rooms on the back of the hotel, you get a very peaceful, rustic view of the wooded hillside behind the hotel. Rooms on the front of the hotel look down onto West Main Street (well below window level), with a view over to I-287 and another busy highway in the middle-distance. Other than that, because of the hillside construction, most of the immediate area around the hotel is taken up by retaining walls and/or parking lots.

Interior: The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished and we found the public areas very comfortable and relaxing. The check-in area is open with plenty of room around it for luggage carts, carry-on bags, etc. while people check in or out. The check-in area also houses a concession area with a nice variety of candy, snacks, beverages and even frozen dinners for their microwave oven, and ice cream. The lobby area opens into a combination guest lounge and breakfast-area, with a large, wall-mounted flat-screen television, a double-sided fireplace, and casually arranged furniture groupings which also includes two large tables suitable for large-family breakfasts, business get-togethers, etc. The serving area for the usual complimentary Hampton Inn breakfast is in a large room immediately off the lounge area, separated from it by decorative see-thru doors during non-breakfast hours.

Rooms: We had a Hampton ""king-study"" room which includes a king-sized bed and a sleep-sofa. We didn't need the sleep sofa for sleeping, but like having the extra space for reading, doing handicrafts, and just spreading out while watching television. It appeared that our room had been recently refurbished as well, with a modern, functional bathroom and newer-style furniture in the bedroom. A couple of things about the room were a bit disconcerting: First, although most Hampton's now include in-room microwaves and mini-refrigerators, our room had neither -- but we knew that before leaving home and planned accordingly. Second, the only drawer space in the entire room was one small drawer in each of the two nightstands, one on each side of the bed. While it's probably not an issue for the in-and-out business traveler, when you're staying in one location for several nights, as we did, it's nice to be able to unpack things a bit. We managed to get by literally living out of our suitcases, but a bit more drawer space would have been nice, especially since there appeared to have be plenty of opportunity to include drawers into the design of the unit supporting the flat-screen television.

Dining: The hotel does not have a restaurant, but does offer the traditional free Hampton Inn breakfast. As frequent visitors to Hampton Inns, we found this breakfast to be one of the better ones we've encountered. The offerings included a hot entree that changed daily, make-your-own-waffles, cold and hot cereals, fresh and cut fruit, toast/bagels, muffins/pastries, fruit juices, yogurts and coffees and teas. The offerings were nicely displayed with room for guests to move among them without feeling crowded. The breakfast area attendants were continuously in the area taking care of spills, frequently restocking food items, and anxious to help guests find whatever they might be looking for. A real high-spot for this property.
Beyond the Hampton breakfast, there didn't appear to be many food choices in the immediate area, and none within an easy walk, at least not in the wintertime. The nearest option, which we used for two evening meals and one lunch was the Eldorado Diner, about 200 yards down the street from the hotel. They have an extensive menu of choices from breakfasts to salads to luncheon ideas to dinners which include soup/salad and vegetables. And they're open 24-hours a day. We found their servings to be extremely generous for the price and the food well-prepared and tasty in a clean, well-lit diner decor. They also have a not-to-be-missed dessert case full of tempting meal-enders. The next closest dining choice appeared to be a mile or more down the road from the hotel.

Staff: We found the staff at this property to be friendly, courteous and eager-to-please. Both our check-in and check-out were handled very efficiently, the breakfast bar staff did an excellent job, and the maintenance folks were quick to respond to two minor maintenance items we found during our first evening at the property (a burned out light bulb and a sliding closet door that had come off its track -- both items were repaired soon after we reported them the next morning).

Overall: We found this property extremely convenient to our travel needs along the I-287 corridor, the staff welcoming and responsive, and the room quiet and in good working order except for the lack of drawer space. The only noticeable drawbacks were the need to climb stairs or hills to get from the hotel to the parking area(s) and the number of stairs between check-in parking and the actual front door (guess we've gotten spoiled by stays at Hampton's where you can wheel the luggage cart out to your vehicle near the front door, load up, and wheel it back in for the elevator ride up to your room -- and do the reverse on your way out). All things considered, we would readily stay at this property again if/when we had business in the White Plains/Tarrytown NY area.", January 2011, Traveled as a couple,none,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,,

The hotel advertises ""new rooms"" but didn't quite cut it. The lobby and breakfast areas have been beautifully remodeled, and in fairness the breakfast spread was well beyond the Hampton standard. Rooms were upgraded with the typical Hampton bedding and towels, but the rest of the hotel was nothing to write home about.

The elevators both had a funk to them for the duration of my stay and looked as though they hadn't been vacuumed in months. Carpeting in the hallways was stained, and the housekeeping staff had a habit of leaving yesterday's trash in the hall until late in the afternoon, causing the halls to smell like yesterday's pizza and other delicacies.

The room was tight quarters and had a very loud air conditioner. When the air conditioner wasn't running, I heard every car that drove by on the expressway. However, the deal breaker was the bathroom. When I first checked in, I noticed a few stray hairs in the bathroom - annoying, but understandable. However, on second inspection, the floors of the tub were a scuzzy gray and the toilet bowl was stained as though it hadn't regularly been cleaned. When I tried the shower, the bath tub managed to be both slimy and sticky at the same time. I skipped two workouts because I couldn't bear to stick my feet in that thing if I didn't have to. The shower head was also pulling away from the wall, and the soap dispenser was placed at shoulder height making maneuvering in the shower without bumping something a challenge. Towards the end of my second night I noticed that water was slowly leaking through the caulking at the base of the toilet. Was it clean water or dirty, the world may never know.

Location is great, right off the freeway near Tappan Zee and close to White Plains. The hotel sits on a hill, and the entrance way is a bit steep. There's plenty of free parking. The front desk girl was simply outstanding... very friendly, very helpful. The breakfast buffet was your typical Hampton Inn breakfast with cereal, mixed fruits, banana, apple, yogurt, couple of hot items, toast, muffins, juice, milk, coffee/tea. There was a business center, which was essentially a tiny room with one computer & printer... don't count on this too much since it was in use by somebody else everytime I went down to try to print something.

The room was okay, and the carpet was soft and clean. Pretty quiet for the most part, and I think the sound insulation is adequate here; if it weren't for that, our loud neighbors would've driven us crazy. This property felt a little bit worn, although I think the housekeeping does as good a job as one could expect to keep the rooms clean. The biggest problems I had...
1).Wireless connection was the worst I've experienced in any Hampton Inn. Kept automatically disconnecting for no reason every 5-10minutes.
2).We had a couple of bath towels that were disgusting with multiple old stains.
3).When I took a shower at 1am, the hottest water I could get was lukewarm.", January 2010, Traveled with family,none,4,4,4,4,4,4,,,

The rooms are nice, and you get FREE high speed internet in your room, and it's super easy to access, not like the trouble I've had at other hotels.
The only issue I've had at this hotel was trying to get a refrigerator in my room. My last trip,I called several days in advance of my arrival to reserve one, was told it would be complimentary, and they would make a note on my reservation of my request. When I arrived I asked to have a fridge in my room, and the lady said she had no record or my request. I was told that it would be $10 per day for the fridge and that ""fridge was based on availability"". I told frontdesk person I understood that, and that I wanted to get one if one was available. She acted like she didn't want to actually go to the effort of finding out if one was available, she just kept saying it was based on availability. It was a really weird conversation. I didn't get anywhere with her. The next day there was a different front desk person who actually seemed to care, and he was able to get me a fridge. I never ended up paying anything extra for the fridge so I don't know whether it really was complimentary or they just screwed up.

Let me start by saying that Mapquest will confuse you (as has been noted previously) with their directions. Both myself and the person checking in in front of me in line were equally confused by this. Once you get off the interstate, I would advise calling the property for directions from that point.

Here is a list of Pros and Cons about this hotel I came up with:

Pros:
-- Value. Yes, you have to realize that hotels cost more in Westchester County then on average.

-- Adequately staffed property. Not a place that expects one or two staff members to run the whole show. This allows for courteous and efficient service, which you will get here.

-- Breakfast. One of the better ones I've seen. Completely complimentary.

-- Wireless internet that you can count on. Again, this is complimentary.

-- In regards to the beds people raised concerns about.... I'm 5'8"" and slept comfortably, no issues with its size.

Cons:
-- Yes, the walls are razor thin, and you will hear your neighbor. That said, turn on the A/C (or the fan while maintaining room temperature, this isn't rocket science), and you drown it out. Problem solved.

-- Doesn't seem to be a lot in walking distance. If you're staying without a car, this could hamper your stay.", September 2008, Traveled with family,none,4,4,4,4,4,4,,4,4

The room was nice and the bed was comfortable. The reviews about the view are true. The front of the hotel faces a highway -- if you're lucky enough to get that. The window of my room on the second floor was blocked by the hotel entrance canopy roof directly in front of it. By peaking around the edge, you could see the highway.

I really had a decent stay and I slept well, but my first impression was not good. After climbing up the steep entrance steps, I was greeted by music blasted from speakers OUTSIDE the hotel. What's with this trend of establishments that feel as if they are radio stations to a parking lot? (A supermarket I go to blasts ""music"" outside its door, too.) I suspect Hampton was trying to conceal the highway noise, but in the process they created their own ridiculous noise.

The public areas were generally clean, but the comments about the elevator are true. A disgusting, matted and dirty carpet lines the elevator floor.

I arrived downstairs for breakfast at 6 AM, and the coffee was hot, and there was a nice fruit salad and other breakfast items in a pleasant dining area with a TV tuned to a morning news show (CNN, I believe).

I brought my laptop and took advantage of the free wireless connection in the rooms. The hotel gives you a code when they issue your room key. It worked good that night, but when I attempted to make a connection the next morning, it told me that my code had expired. Shouldn't the service be valid for the duration of your stay?

The front desk woman assigned me a room (I don't remember the actual number, but let's pretend it was 510) and gave me my key.

I went up to the fifth floor and tried to enter room 510. My key wouldn't work - the door swipe entry gave me a blinking red light, indicating it wasn't either keyed properly or something was going on.

I got back on the elevator (all of this was lugging my briefcase, luggage, et cetera, mind you), figured it was an honest mistake, and explained it to the front desk lady. She typed around on the computer for a few minutes, exclaimed ""The reason it wouldn't work is because you're not assigned to 510!"" I showed her where she had clearly written, on the key card jacket, in the Room Space: 510. She said ""Oops! Sorry, you're in room 305. Your key should work for room 305.""

I got back on the elevator, went up to room 305, and the key worked (hooray) but as soon I as I walked into the room, I realized that other people were in the room! And not just IN the room, but staying in the room! That was awkward and potentially dangerous! (It was 9pm at night).

We all trooped downstairs to the front desk AGAIN where the woman, who still had not yet apologized once for the inconvenience, banged around on her computer for a little while longer, said ""Oops! I didn't realize 305 was booked. You're in room 418.""

And, dragging all of my luggage, briefcase, et cetera, got back in the elevator and to my room (FINALLY!) where I found a MINUSCULE bed.

I'm an average weight woman who stands 5'4 tall and with my head at the very top of the headboard, my feet almost extended longer than the bed.

While most Hamptons feel bright and clean, this one seems worn and in need of an update. The lobby is actually quite nice and room was fine, but other spaces such as hallways are slightly dingy. The front desk was busy, often with a line up. They normally had only one person working, so you'd get interrupted (often) when she had to answer the phone.

Word of warning about directions. First, the hotel is not easy to spot. The entrance is up a steep hill, so you'll need to keep your eyes peeled while driving on Rt. 119. That street is a divided road, so you may need to make a U-turn to access the hotel. (I never figured out if that's legal or not!)

The Hampton Inn White Plains/Tarrytown was decent for our stay, although I am more partial to the SpringHill Suites down the road, that offers a similar experience but larger rooms.", June 2007, Traveled with family,none,3,1,1,1,1,1,,1,

It sets the tone of how the rest of your stay will be. When I walked into the hotel one young lady was dressed in what looked to be a uniform except it was untucked, looked like it had been worn while she slept and got up and came to work. The other gentlemen looked like he didn't care about his personal hygiene. I would think management would expect associates to present there best self while on the job to portray a good image of the hotel. I guess not. I don't know what management focuses on but as I traveled up the elevator and got off on the 6th floor there was a strong odor of marijuana coming from someone's room. Unless I missed the memo I didn't think pot had been legalized? Why this goes on in the hotel is beyond me? I had my young son with me and I was visiting my parents who had to deal with this during their leisure visit here. Not so pleasant. In addition to all the above mentioned as if this wasn't enough, the breakfast on one particular morning was cold and the breakfast attendant rushed us out because it was close to closing time. I guess they wanted to clear us out so they could go home! This was an awful stay. I hope management comes out of their office and starts inspecting these areas because the only thing that I can say that was perfect during my stay was the room!", May 2007,none,none,1,,,,,,,,

Be sure to ask the hotel for directions - Mapquest puts this hotel in the wrong place, and apparently the hotel staff has been trying to correct the problem with no luck. After I finally arrived I had no trouble checking in. The room and bathroom were clean and smelled fresh, and the bed had a nice fluffy duvet cover on it. I requested a room in the back of the hotel, since the front faces two highways. My room was quiet.

Parking later in the evening was a problem since the hotel was hosting an event in the conference room, but I was eventually able to find a spot. Since this property is located on a hill you might want to drive right up to the front door and unload if you have a lot of luggage.

The breakfast was the standard Hampton Inn fare, including the excellent choices of coffee. The breakfast area was clean and had been well-stocked.

Check out was a breeze, and everyone was very friendly during my stay, which is not always the case in Westchester County! I would definitely recommend this hotel!", April 2007, Traveled on business,none,4,1,1,1,1,,,1,

It was an OUTSTANDING hotel.

The room was spacious and clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds that I have ever slept in. The staff at the front desk were extremely friendly and accomadating and the breakfast in the mornings were excellant.

All in all, I was extremely impressed and have full intentions on trying to stay at a Hampton Inn for any future trips I have to take.", June 2006,none,none,5,,,,,,,,

Good size (and perfectly clean) rooms - mine had king bed plus a love seat that folds out to a twin bed, and a nice work desk with comfy work chair. Free in-room wireless internet access.

Desk staff helpful and efficient, if somewhat cheerless.

No in-room refrigerator but there is a coffee maker, and free continental breakfast happens downstairs. No restaurants (or anything else for that matter) within walking distance.

Extraordinarily thin walls - even quiet neighbors are audible (if not for noise I would have rated this hotel one notch higher). Front rooms face a nearby freeway; rear rooms face a wooded hillside.

I'd stay here again, especially at the $89 weekend rate.",none,none,none,3,,,,,,,,

The hotel itself has been renovated and is very nice, but the staff needs to learn that they are in the ""people"" business. Also, they rigidly enforce a 3PM check-in time when it's obvious there are clean rooms ready and available....again....NOT in the best-interests of a guest who arrives somewhat early!",none,none,none,2,,,,,,,,
