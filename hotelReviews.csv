When checking in the night staff who was assisting me was not wearing a face mask and throughout my stay I could see multiple night staff not wearing masks as they interacted with guests. Upon check in the room was sufficient and clean, but the door to the hallway was lose and let a lot of light in. The next few days the 1st floor near the elevators and the back entrance always smelt of marijuana and people were smoking marijuana in their vehicles with the windows rolled down. I watched at least 6 people come in and out of the hotel back entrance with no mask and roam the hallways and use the elevator with no mask. I was in the elevator and someone came in with no mask also. The hotel has security cameras throughout the hallways which you can see behind the front desk but no one uses them to enforce rules. I was hoping the drug use would have only been a one day event but every morning on my way out of the room I could smell marijuana and could see people smoking it in hotel parking lot. I would never stay here again.", February 2021,Trip type: Traveled on business,none,1,5,5,5,5,5,5
