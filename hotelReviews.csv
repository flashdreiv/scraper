The property is run down and needs some attention. Our room wasn't as clean as it should have been, the bathroom dingy, especially the bathtub, and water stains are visible in the bathroom, as well as sloppy work, like paint spattered on the floor and tile missing. I can live with that, but I can't live with false advertisement. They advertise on the website (and show pictures) of the ""free"" breakfast spread. I actually called to ask again if they have breakfast and they said they did. I happen to like breakfast and was very disappointed when my husband and I went downstairs to receive a paper bag with water, cake, fruit bar and an apple. Other than the apple, for many people, this wasn't a healthy, nor looking at their pictures on line, the breakfast promised. My husband and I wanted to take a few days off from our business and we were looking forward to cooling off in their pool. The pool was filthy, with food wrapping and used diapers spread all over. I asked twice to remove the dirty diapers with no result. Trust me when I say we really didn't want to go into the pool. Also, they have rules that the maximum capacity for the pool is 7 people. We counted 12, all under 12 years old, screaming their way to ecstasy. For the money we paid, I can't recommend this hotel.", July 2021,none," find another hotel, but if stuck, get a room on the opposite side of the highway!!!",1,,4,,4,4,

First location is terrible. It sets high on a hill but you can’t make a left turn into or out of the parking lot. You have to go down the street and turn around. This can be tricky due to the traffic in the area. When entering the parking lot there’s a small sign directing a u turn then up the hill for checkin. The handicap ramp is from the parking area and not in front of the checkin. Checkin was basically ok no welcome just name and here’s your room key. Did not get the room requested although I made reservations 6 months ago and was told plenty rooms were available like I wanted. Clerk did not even say sorry just not available. Also did not receive the bottle of water as a honors member. Now to get to the room we had to park up the hill to the second floor level. Take our bags walk around the pool enter the second floor walk down the hallway to the elevator then up to our floor. At our room the door was damaged, looked like someone had previously tried to break in. The inside safety latch was very loose almost ready to fall off. Inside room was good size but bathroom was very small. Could not open door when setting on toilet. Rust in bathtub. Room decor was outdated still had popcorn ceiling. Rug stained and old. There was no safe in the room for security no microwave. Internet service was very poor in the room. Breakfast was pitiful it came in a bag small breakfast bar, small piece of what tasted like cake. Coffee weak all most water. We left it. Management needs to get busy and update, clean up, repair and improve checkin service.

So far on this road trip we have stayed in six Hampton Inns and this is by far the worst.", June 2021, Traveled as a couple,none,2,,,,,,

When checking in the night staff who was assisting me was not wearing a face mask and throughout my stay I could see multiple night staff not wearing masks as they interacted with guests. Upon check in the room was sufficient and clean, but the door to the hallway was lose and let a lot of light in. The next few days the 1st floor near the elevators and the back entrance always smelt of marijuana and people were smoking marijuana in their vehicles with the windows rolled down. I watched at least 6 people come in and out of the hotel back entrance with no mask and roam the hallways and use the elevator with no mask. I was in the elevator and someone came in with no mask also. The hotel has security cameras throughout the hallways which you can see behind the front desk but no one uses them to enforce rules. I was hoping the drug use would have only been a one day event but every morning on my way out of the room I could smell marijuana and could see people smoking it in hotel parking lot.

It so happened that we stayed here in mid March when the pandemic was just emerging and I thought that the precautions they were taking then were very diligent. We had me travel from Florida to this area again in June and because of our prior experience, and because of reading about Hilton's  cleaning  policies, I chose to stay here again. First of all, I believe that the Hilton policy does not necessarily apply to all hotels that have the Hilton brand and this is something that needs to be checked by all travelers. In addition, the lack of precautions at this hotel was alarming. Even though it is located in New York , almost none of the guests wore masks, and the staff did not ask the guests to wear a mask.  This was in contrast to just about every other business I visited in the Westchester Tarrytown area. I believe that the hotel suffers from poor management. As an example, the entrance/exit lobby was being mopped at 8 AM, at a time when people are more prone to exit. Why they shouldn’t have been done so at an earlier or later hour is beyond me.  Also, when we went to a room one night, they were too young men, not kids but young men, wrestling in the hallway. There were no sanitizer dispensers available in common areas (although there had been in March when we were there). .  We were told by a staff member that the hotel was being used by many individuals who were working on construction projects nearby.  For whatever reasons, those guests did not wear a mask and that made our entire experience stressful. To their credit, the clerks were polite and in fact refunded one night's rate because of the wrestling incident. Even so, we left the hotel and stayed at a nearby hotel of a different brand where the precautions were totally in place and provided greater concerns for safety.", June 2020,none,none,1,,3,3,,3,

There was no clock in the room, which I don't think I have experienced in event he cheapest hotels I have stayed in. There were big areas of the ceiling that had clearly been patched, but not with the same texture/color as the original ceiling. When I tried to turn on the light on the side of the bed, the entire fixture was loose and turned in the wall.

The furnishings in the room are really low quality and show extensive wear. It looks like the hotel tried to make the appearance of a makeover using the cheapest items they could find.

I was attending an event for New Years and wanted to be close enough to uber there and back. When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a tall, lively African American gentleman , who thanked me for being a member and invited me to the hotels New Years function later that night. When I got to my room, I wasn’t overly impressed with the decor, but it will do for one night. The problem with my stay began when I went to step into the shower and there was hair in my bath tub. Yuck, it was disgusting. I had to use a tissue to remove the previous guests hair before I could shower. Great. After that, I realized that there were no washcloths in the room at all. Only hand towels and bath towels. I sighed, and wrapped in my towel went to call the front desk for assistance. The phone rang for several minutes with no answer. I then peeked outside my room to see if by luck, housekeeping was in the hallway. When I saw a cart two rooms down, I thought, Yesssss I'm saved. ' Excuse me miss, May I have a washcloth?"" Without looking up, she responded "" I don't have any"". Huh. So I retreat back into my room and try guest services on the phone. To my surprise a female picked up, I asked her for a few washcloths to please be sent up to my room.......I waited for 30 minutes and received nothing. Finally I took matters into my own hands, got dressed, and went downstairs. When I got to the lobby, I found that there are in fact two employees standing at the front desk. I patiently waited for a hispanc female who's name begins with H to call me up. Taking a deep breath , I informed her of my ridiculous wait time for two measly washcloths and also the condition of my tub when I arrived. Without apologizing, she looked at me, turned and went to a back room. When she emerged, she had two washcloths. Sigh. I rushed back upstairs, jumped in the shower, and tried my best not to allow that issue to ruin my New Years Eve. I mean I'm only paying $185 to stay here. Is it too much to ask to have a washcloth and a clean tub? I'm so dissatisfied with my stay. I've stayed at Hiltons in different states and never have an issue. My loyalty to the company comes from my late uncle who worked for the Hilton for over 20 years. I will never stay at this location again. Do better", January 2020, Traveled solo,none,1,3,3,3,3,3,3

Some with kids, some walking cautiously. It was a perfect place to stay and to be together. Breakfast is included and has lots of kid-friendly foods: yogurt, fruit, cereals, waffles. The hot breakfast menu changes on a daily basis: port sausage patties one day, chicken sausage day two, link sausage day three. The scrambled eggs are probably powdered - they have that crumbly look. But, all in all, a decent free breakfast.
The evening following the funeral, we all wanted to spend time together before spreading to the winds. The hotel let us use the area adjacent to the lobby as long as we cleaned up after ourselves. So, we unpacked our wine, our cheese, our crackers and we had a family reunion for a couple of hours.
